# Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of two powerful techniques for programmatically analyzing Python code. It contrasts Structural Analysis using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) with Semantic Analysis using modern Transformer models. The core objective is to demonstrate how these methods offer different "lenses" through which we can understand code: one focusing on the rigid grammatical architecture and the other on the abstract functional meaning.

The analysis pipeline processes a diverse set of Python snippets, extracts quantitative and vector-based features, and uses data visualization to reveal insights, compare model "understanding," and showcase the practical applications of each approach.

Core Concepts: Two Lenses for Code Analysis
The fundamental difference between the two methods lies in what they "see" in the code.

# üß† Structural Analysis (AST)
This method is analogous to diagramming a sentence in grammar class. It deconstructs code into its fundamental grammatical parts without any regard for the meaning behind them.

What it is: An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a precise, hierarchical representation of code. Each line of code is converted into a tree of nodes, where each node represents a specific construct like a function definition (FunctionDef), a loop (For), or a mathematical operation.

What it ignores: It completely disregards comments, whitespace, formatting, and the specific names of variables or functions. It only cares about the code's structure.

Strength: This approach provides perfect precision for tasks that require exact structural information, such as linting, code refactoring, or counting specific language features.

# ü§ñ Semantic Analysis (Embeddings)
This method is analogous to understanding the meaning or intent of a sentence, regardless of how it's phrased. It focuses on what the code does.

What it is: An embedding is a dense vector (a list of numbers) that numerically represents the meaning of a piece of text or code. Transformer models, trained on vast datasets, learn to generate these vectors.

The Principle: Code snippets that perform similar functions (e.g., two different ways of sorting a list) should produce embeddings that are mathematically "close" to each other in vector space.

Strength: This approach is powerful for tasks like code search (finding functionally similar code), clone detection, and categorizing code by its purpose, as it captures meaning beyond direct syntax.

# Methodology in Detail
Method 1: Structural Analysis Implementation (AST)
The structural analysis is performed using a custom CodeAnalyzer class that systematically walks through the AST of each code snippet.

Parsing: For each snippet, ast.parse(code) is called to generate the root node of its AST.

Tree Traversal: The CodeAnalyzer class inherits from ast.NodeVisitor, which provides the framework for visiting each node in the tree.

Feature Counting: Specific methods like visit_FunctionDef(self, node) and visit_For(self, node) are implemented. When the visitor encounters a node of a matching type, the corresponding method is executed, which increments a counter in a self.features dictionary.

Aggregation: The parse_code_to_dataframe() function orchestrates this process for all snippets, handling syntax errors and compiling the final feature counts into a clean pandas DataFrame, with each row representing a snippet and each column a feature.

Method 2: Semantic Analysis Implementation (Embeddings)
The semantic analysis leverages pre-trained models from the Hugging Face transformers library.

Model Loading: Four different models are loaded: MiniLM, DistilRoBERTa, MPNet, and CodeBERT. CodeBERT is particularly relevant as it was specifically pre-trained on a large corpus of source code, making it adept at understanding code semantics.

Embedding Generation: For each snippet and model, the following occurs:

Tokenization: The code string is converted into a sequence of numerical tokens that the model can understand.

Model Inference: The tokens are passed through the Transformer model, which outputs a hidden state for each token.

Pooling: The mean_pooling function is used to average the token embeddings (weighted by an attention mask) into a single, fixed-size vector. This vector is the final embedding for the code snippet.

# Analysis of Embeddings:

Cosine Similarity: To compare how different models "see" the same code, the cosine similarity between their resulting embeddings is calculated. A score near 1.0 indicates a very similar semantic interpretation.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): To visualize the relationships between different snippets as understood by a single model (CodeBERT), PCA is used to reduce the high-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 768 dimensions) down to 2 dimensions for plotting on a scatter graph.

Aggregated Features: The bar chart showed that functions (6) were the most common construct, followed by imports (3) and loops (4). This gives a high-level architectural overview of the code samples.

Pattern Distribution: The pie chart illustrated the makeup of control flow and advanced patterns. Loops were the most frequent (44.4%), followed by conditionals (22.2%) and list comprehensions (22.2%), with error handling and lambdas being less common.

Transformer Embeddings Results
The embedding analysis provided a more nuanced view of the code's functional relationships.

| **MiniLM**      | 384                 |

Analysis 2a: Inter-Model Similarity: The heatmap comparing model embeddings for Snippet 1 (a class with a loop) revealed how similarly the models interpret the code's meaning.

# Table: Cosine Similarity for Snippet 1

### üîç Model Similarity Matrix

| Model           | MiniLM | DistilRoBERTa | CodeBERT | MPNet |
|----------------|--------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **MiniLM**      | 1.000  | 0.932         | 0.916    | 0.899 |
| **DistilRoBERTa** | 0.932  | 1.000         | 0.983    | 0.936 |
| **MPNet**        | 0.899  | 0.936         | 0.931    | 1.000 |

The extremely high similarity between CodeBERT and DistilRoBERTa (0.983) suggests their underlying representations for this code are almost identical. This confirms that general-purpose models can be highly effective, but CodeBERT is expected to have a better-tuned understanding for code-specific nuances.

Analysis 2b: Inter-Snippet Similarity (via CodeBERT): The PCA plot visualized the semantic space of all 10 snippets. The clustering of points was not random but based on functional similarity.

List Comprehension Cluster: Snippet 2 ([x*x for x in range(10)]) and Snippet 5 ([x*x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]) were positioned very close together. This shows CodeBERT recognized them as functionally similar despite the syntactic difference (the added if clause).

Class Definition Cluster: Snippet 1 (class DataProcessor) and Snippet 7 (class User) were also grouped together, separate from other snippets. This indicates the model identifies the high-level pattern of defining a class structure.

Simple Loop Cluster: Snippet 3 (a while loop) and Snippet 9 (nested for loops) were located in a similar region, reflecting their shared purpose of iteration.

This visualization powerfully demonstrates that embeddings capture an abstract understanding of code's purpose, correctly identifying similarities that a purely structural analysis would miss.
